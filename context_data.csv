"brand: L'oreal Paris $ categories: Conditioner $ name: L'oreal Paris Elvive Extraordinary Clay Rebalancing Conditioner - 12.6 Fl Oz $ reviews_text: I received the L'Oral Extrodinary Clay product line about a month ago and am In love! Not only are they a great value price wise but it's been a total game changer in my morning routine. The product line definitely delivers on its promise of keeping your roots from getting greasy and your ends from being dry for 48 hours and I've found it to go above and beyond that! I never washed my hair daily but usually every other day and sometimes every 3 days depending on what I was doing and how I wore my hair but with this line from L'Oral I can now easily go 3 days between washs with no need for dry shampoo and sometimes even 4 days! Think about that for a minute... 4 days between having to wash your hair! It's a huge time saver and has made my morning routine so much less rushed by making it so I'm only washing my hair 1-2 times per week! Plus you can't beat the price! An all around great product line that I would highly recommend, I even let my Mom test it out and she's hooked now too.

"brand: L'oreal Paris $ categories: Conditioner $ name: L'oreal Paris Elvive Extraordinary Clay Rebalancing Conditioner - 12.6 Fl Oz $ reviews_text: Loreal Extraordinary Clay Pre-Shampoo Mask (spread throughout dry roots and rinse out after 5 minutes), Shampoo Conditioner for oily roots and dry ends. The claim is *up to* 48 hours of purified roots and hydrated ends. Bottom line: Yes this 3-step system did help control my oily roots better than my normal shampoo and conditioner. No it did not control it for 48 hours. But I did get over 24! Im a person who can never skip a day of washing my hair (not if I want to leave the house). And with this system, I still can't. BUT I found I could get up the next morning and run errands if I need to, without looking like a hobo. This 3-step system definitely pro-longed the need to wash my hair by several hours. For example, after washing my hair around 6:30 on a Friday morning, by Saturday morning my hair still looked clean and presentable enough to be seen in public - up until about 11 am. After that my hair started to feel grimy and weird, and it lost all volume. I ended up having to pull it back up in a pony tail because it was laying so flat to my head. Dont get me wrong though, this is still a major improvement. Usually my hair is a greasy mess by 8 or 9 pm the same day that I wash it. So all in all, if I have something to run out and do early the next day, then yes the time and effort of using this 3 step system would be a worth it and helpful time saver. But I wouldnt bother with it every day. Which is good because there isnt enough product in the hair mask tub for you to do it every day anyway. It is a tad difficult to spread the mask throughout the roots of your hair when your hair is dry. You end up using a lot, no matter how hard you try to use it sparingly. So just a note, you will run out of the mask long before you run out of the shampoo and conditioner, unless you only use it for special occasions Which brings me to results of using the shampoo and conditioner alone, for those who are interested in just trying those two items. Bottom line: Its still great for oily roots! I wash my hair in the morning and its soft and bouncy and full of volume all throughout my work day - and on into the night. My ends felt hydrated and my roots didnt start to get oily until around 2 am. Which makes me very happy! I can have late night plans after work and my hair is one less thing I have to worry about! This line gets a thumbs up from me for every day wear, even without the mask. Received free from Influenster for testing and review purposes. All opinions are my own.
